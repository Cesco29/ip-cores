This project reuses "as-is" the uart16750 project from opencores.org
The rtl is compiled into logical gates into a netlist.
And then it is used in this form let the v586 core communicate on serial port.
The original files are put inside the ./uart16750 as downloaded from opencores.org

Note: the example system assembles v586 core with several peripherals,
two instances of uart16750 are used for two serial ports.
